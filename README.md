The Message Counter App for Android API 11 (Honeycomb) and above. "Message Counter" is an Android app that displays the number of messages sent from each contact.

Although the initial version was pretty basic and took only a few days to complete, it wasn't optimal and the User Interface was non intuitive. So a completely redesigned and rewritten app with the same aim is presented here.

Features:
- Set limit and track the number of messages sent in a cycle
- Shows the number of SMS messages in inbox, sent and total.
- Sorted list of contact and message count from them
- Shortcut to contact details using quick contact badge
- A pie chart view of the top message senders
- Follows latest Android design patterns
- Uses the Holo Theme
- No ads
